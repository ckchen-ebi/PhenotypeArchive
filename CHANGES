                      EBI Phenotype Archive Release Notes

Introduction
------------
The EBI Phenotype Archive is an open source project to store, analyse and 
present genotype associated phenotypes information on the web.
This project is funded by the NIH KOMP2 grant and supported by the IMPC 
consortium.

The web application runs in a Java servlet container such as Tomcat.

See https://github.com/mpi2/PhenotypeArchive for more information.

Getting Started
---------------
You need a Java 1.6 VM or later installed and a servlet container.

================== Release 0.1.3 ==================

Status
------
Also Known as the Toronto release.
This is the first release of the PhenotypeArchive in GitHub.
It contains several improvements and bug fixing based on user feedback.

Detailed Change List
--------------------

New features
 1.  faceted search on phenotype images (procedures, anatomy, phenotypes, genes)
 2.  consistent view of data across the site using the jquery data table
 3.  filtering of phenotype terms on the MP and gene page
 4.  data export in CSV and Excel format
 5.  annotation view of the image result 
 6.  genotype information association to images
 7.  provenance associated to images
 8.  links to legacy data in the phenotype association panel of the gene page 
 9.  ES Cell and Allele panel on the gene page
 10. Work in progress notice for images
 11. IMPC style reproduced (menu, orange bar)
 12. syntax correction: procedures instead of protocols, using plural instead of 
     singular
 13. link to pre-QC data added when relevant   
 14. see the total number of results per facet by default on search page
 15. Phenotype Archive distributed in GitHub

Bug fixes
 1. image metada properly displayed
 2. correct zygosity stored and displayed

Changes in runtime behavior
 1. Java 7
 2. Tomcat 7
 
Other Changes
 1. Anatomy facet removed (will reintroduced it later)
 2. Phenotype calls grouped by genotype (gender collapsed)
